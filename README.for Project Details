# Istanbul Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Sciences

This is a management system for a research center.This system can handle all the details of this international institute,including
the library and users.

Visual Studio for C# with Windows Forms App.is used for Graphical User Interface(GUI).And this project is connected with database
through Microsoft SQL Server, so all datas for the institute are kept inside the database,and both Users and Managers can manage
adding or deleting record through C# interface.And also Manager can control the database from SQL Server itself.

Solution Name = IstanbulResearchCenter
Project Name = SciencesStudies
Database  in SQL Server = InstituteDb
There are 14 separate tables inside InstituteDb for the objects below. 

List of objects : 
1.General Members
2.Academicians
3.Researchers 
4.Teachers 
5.College Students 
6.Foreign Members
7.Books in General
8.World Literature Books
9.Social Sciences Books
10.Mathematical Sciences Books
11.English Books
12.Journals
13.Newspapers
14.Order List 

In this project,we want to work with the content of the Object Relational Mapping system.So we implement Entity Framework
from "Manage Nuget Packages" where developers can install new libraries or systems inside .NET Framework.After installing Entity Framework, two new libraries(Entity Framework ve E.F.SQL Server) will come inside References at Solution Explorer.

NOTE !! : Entity Framework uses 3 different approaches for Object Relational Mapping Models.
-Database First Approach
-Code First Approach
-Model First Approach

In order to use Database First Approach,we first need to open SQL Server and then create a new database(using a new query) with
14 tables with their columns.Let's name the database "InstituteDb".

Here,for the project,we will use Database First Approcah(for new entity model for tables).To do so,we right click on project name
at solution explorer and then go to Add New Item - Data - AdoNet entity Data Model.Let's name the model DbModelsAltogether.
We then choose Entity Framework Designer From Database.

Then we click on New Connection - Server Name = (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB(our server) -  InstituteDb - and then check the all tables.
This process is known as "Database First Approach".

////////////////
After completing the whole project :
There will exist 27 forms and  22 classes(each of them is for Entity Framework Operations-add,update,delete,and search)
We will use folder systems at solution explorer to prevent the solution explorer from being very complicated and confusing.
